**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when playing this clicker game because of the limited automation options. For example, I have to constantly click or monitor the game to make progress, which can be tiring and time-consuming.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to see an enhanced automation feature in the game. This could include options like auto-clicking, automated resource collection, or the ability to set up custom automation rules for different game stages.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative solution could be the introduction of mini-games or challenges that can reward players with temporary automation boosts or bonuses. This way, players can engage in different activities within the game while still benefiting from periods of automation.

**Additional context**
This feature would significantly improve the gaming experience, especially for those who play the game for extended periods. It would reduce the need for constant interaction and allow players to enjoy the game with less repetitive strain.
